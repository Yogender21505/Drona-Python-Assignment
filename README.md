# Drona-Python-Assignment
Python Script for Drone simulation and Sender, receiver program
# Part 1
# Simulated Drone Movement System

This Python program simulates the movement of a drone using the Turtle module. The drone can move in four directions: forward, backward, left, and right.

## Requirements

1. Utilize the Turtle module for graphical representation.
2. Design functions that control the drone's movement: move_forward, move_backward, move_left, and move_right.

## Instructions

1. Install the Turtle module if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install PythonTurtle
2. Run python Q1.py

## Following outputs:

# Part 2
# Sender and Receiver

# TCP Receiver Program

This Python program (`receiver.py` and 'sender.py' ) is designed to receive messages from a sender using TCP sockets.

## Requirements

1. Accept incoming connections.
2. Display received messages.
3. Implement error handling for socket operations.
   
## Instructions

1. Install the Turtle module if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install PythonTurtle
2. Run
3. open terminal
   ```bash
   python receiver.py
5. open another terminal and run
   ```bash
   python sender.py
